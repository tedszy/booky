# Booky the bookbinder's Assistant!

### Intro

A stack of editions of the same publication are cut to standard dimensions
and arranged into volumes. The standard dimensions and the thickness 
of the volume determines the the dimensions of the book-binding components.
Bookbinding jobs are summarized by tickets. One publication, several
volumes. The user supplies a code for the publication, the volume
thickness, and the title to put on the volume. Booky looks up the
data on that publication by the given code, then computes binding
component dimensions, and arranges everything into a nice looking 
ticket-like table.
