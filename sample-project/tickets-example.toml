#
# Define your tickets. Ticket keys (names) must be unique.
# Then arrange your tickets into pages in a booklet.
# A booklet is defined by an array of arrays. 
# Each row in the pages array is one page of tickets.
#
# You can have as many booklets as you like, 
# just give them unique names.
# 
# A ticket key looks like this
#
# ticket.XXXXX
# 
# The first part has to be "ticket" but you can put any unique
# name after the dot. The reference to your ticket in the booklet
# has to match this unique ticket identifier.
